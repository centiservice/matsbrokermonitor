/**
 * Provides a way to get data from the broker which is not possible to glean from the Mats system itself, nor from
 * standard ways over the JMS API (or any other known messaging protocol).
 * <p />
 * These data are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Which destinations exist, and whether they are queues and topics (however, the total number of Mats endpoints can
 * been found by asking all MatsFactories)</li>
 * <li>Dead Letter Queues - both properly configured (on the broker) Individual Dead Letter Queues, and any unfortunate
 * (typically default) global DLQs</li>
 * <li>Biggest point: <b>The number of messages on the destination or Dead Letter Queue</b></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Note: "Fully Qualified Destination Name" means that the name fully specifies the queue or topic, e.g. for ActiveMQ
 * this includes a schema-like notation "queue://" or "topic://" as prefix. This to handle a queue having the same name
 * as a topic - even though the Mats API forbids this: An "endpointId" shall fully qualify a Mats endpoint, no matter if
 * it is e.g. a "terminator" (queue-based) or "subscriptionTerminator" (topic-based).
