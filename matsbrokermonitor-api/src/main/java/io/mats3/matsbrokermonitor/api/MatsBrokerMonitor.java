/**
 * Provides a way to get data from the broker which is not possible to glean from the Mats3 system itself, nor from
 * standard ways by the JMS API (or any other known messaging protocol).
 * <p />
 * These data are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Which destinations exist, and whether they are queues and topics (however, the total number of Mats endpoints can
 * been found by asking all MatsFactories).</li>
 * <li>Dead Letter Queues, both properly configured (on the broker) Individual Dead Letter Queues, and any unfortunate
 * (typically default) global DLQ.</li>
 * <li>Biggest point: <b>The number of messages on all the destinations and Dead Letter Queues.</b></li>
 * <li>Bonus point: The age of any head (first) message on the queue.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * Note: "Fully Qualified Destination Name" means that the name fully specifies the queue or topic, e.g. for ActiveMQ
 * this includes a schema-like notation "queue://" or "topic://" as prefix. This to handle a queue having the same name
 * as a topic - even though the Mats API forbids this: An "endpointId" fully qualifies a Mats endpoint seen from the
 * MatsFactory's side, no matter if it is e.g. a "terminator" (queue-based) or "subscriptionTerminator" (topic-based).
 * <p/>
 * Note: This is the "monitor the queues" part of the MatsBrokerMonitor. The "browse the queues and actions on messages"
 * part is found in {@link MatsBrokerBrowseAndActions}. The reason for this separation of the API is that the pieces
 * defined in this piece are not part of a standard JMS API and must be implemented specifically for each broker, while
 * the "control" part can be implemented using standard JMS API.
 *
 * @see UpdateEvent for more information about how the information is presented and updated.
 * @see MatsBrokerBrowseAndActions for the API to browse and act upon the messages on the destinations.
