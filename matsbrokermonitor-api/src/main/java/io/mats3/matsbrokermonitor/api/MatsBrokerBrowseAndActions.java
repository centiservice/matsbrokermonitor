 * API for browsing queues and performing actions on messages of a Mats Broker. This is the API that the Mats Broker
 * Monitor uses to browse and perform actions on the broker.

 * Note: This is the "read queues and actions on messages" API, which complement the "monitor the broker" API which is
 * {@link MatsBrokerMonitor}. The reason for this separation of the API is that the pieces defined in this part can be
 * done with ordinary JMS operations, while the operations in the monitor API are not part of a standard JMS API and
 * must be implemented specifically for each broker.
