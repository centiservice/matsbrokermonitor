     * Top interface for the different "additions" that can be made to the Monitor GUI - you implement the extensions of
     * this interface based on what GUI features you need, and then add them to the Monitor GUI when you create it.
     * <p>
     * <b>Important security notice 1:</b> If you employ the {@link AccessControl AccessControl} interface made
     * available to the addition, and remove buttons or columns based on the user's access, you must ensure that the
     * backend also implements the security check: If you only remove the button or column from the HTML, the user can
     * still access the functionality by manually crafting the URL to the backend.
     * <p>
     * <b>Important security notice 2:</b> There is no escaping of the HTML that you return from the methods in the
     * sub-interfaces of this interface, so you must ensure that you HTML-escape all output values.
     * <p>
     * <b>Performance notice:</b> The additions are invoked "in-line" in the rendering. Whatever time it takes to render
     * the addition, will be added to the time it takes to render the page. Thus, if you e.g. invoke a slow REST service
     * to get information for the addition for each message in a "Browse Queue" view, this will slow down the rendering
     * of the page significantly (This GUI maxes out at 2000 messages, while ActiveMQ maxes out at 400). If you do need
     * to query some external resource per message (e.g. a Jira instance), you should probably make some kind of caching
     * on the backend to make this work well. An alternative is to let the addition just be an id'ed placeholder HTML,
     * and then, after the rendering is finished, add a bit of JavaScript to asynchronously fetch status for each of
     * those placeholders, replacing each of the placeholders with the actual status and maybe a link to the external
     * resource if relevant. This way, the page render won't be held back, and the user can start browsing the messages
     * while the status is fetched in the background.
     * <p>
     * <b>CSS-classes, and "external link"-icon:</b> You can make a button, or a link rendered exactly like a button (to
     * e.g. take the user to your logging system for this message's flow): There are a set of CSS classes that will make
     * your button, or link, look like the other buttons in the Mats Broker Monitor GUI pages' button rows. These
     * classes are "matsbm-button" paired with one of "matsbm-button-blue", "matsbm-button-green",
     * "matsbm-button-yellow", and "matsbm-button-red". The blue is the standard "action" color. In the button-row, if
     * you want your additions to align to the right side, you can prefix the added HTML with
     * "<code>&lt;span class='spacer'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code>". In addition, for links that send users to another page,
     * an "external link" icon is provided, which you can add as such:
     * "<code>&lt;span class='matsbm_external_link_icon'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code>".
     * <p>
     * <b>Tips for implementing "send to log system" button</b> (which probably is the most common and important
     * addition): You definitely want to add this as a link, not a JS button, as the user will typically want to open
     * the link in a new tab (i.e. right-click and select "Open in new tab" or "Open in new window", or middle-click)
     * You also want to add the "external link" icon, so that it is clear that this is a link to an external system.
     * Implementation wise, it might be a good idea to let the link first point back to the server hosting the Mats
     * Broker Monitor GUI, and then have the server construct the actual link to the logging system and redirect the
     * user - instead of constructing the addition links as pointing directly to the logging system. By doing this, you
     * are more in control of the URL, and can e.g. add some security tokens to the URL, and log the access to the link,
     * monitor usage, etc. You can then also go a bit creative for usability, and first query the logging backend to see
     * what are the first and last date-times for the messages in the flow (using the traceId), and then add those
     * date-times to the log system URL, so that the user is taken directly to the relevant time range in the logging
     * system. If you on the backend would like to have the full {@link MatsBrokerMessageRepresentation
     * MatsBrokerMessageRepresentation}, you can let the 'addition link' rendered in the GUI include two parameters:
     * {@link MatsBrokerDestination#getDestinationName() MatsBrokerDestination.getDestinationName()} and
     * {@link MatsBrokerMessageRepresentation#getMessageSystemId()
     * MatsBrokerMessageRepresentation.getMessageSystemId()}, which you on the backend can use to query for the
     * {@code MatsBrokerMessageRepresentation} using {@link MatsBrokerBrowseAndActions#examineMessage(String, String)
     * MatsBrokerBrowseAndActions.examineMessage(queueName, messageSystemId)}. Alternatively, you can just include the
     * {@link MatsBrokerMessageRepresentation#getTraceId() MatsBrokerMessageRepresentation.getTraceId()}, since this is
     * typically what you'd send to the logging system, querying for all log lines with that traceId.
